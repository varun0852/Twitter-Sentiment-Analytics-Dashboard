🏆 **Best Cross-Validation F1: 86.61%**
⚙️ **Best Params:** `max_depth: 20, min_samples_leaf: 1, min_samples_split: 2, n_estimators: 200`

## 🎯 Objective

Predict whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) based on demographic and account features — enabling proactive retention strategies that save revenue.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Size:** ~7,000 records
- **Target:** Churn (1 = churned, 0 = retained)
- **Features:** Age, Balance, Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Tenure, Number of Products, Active Member, Estimated Salary

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **SMOTE significantly improved Recall** — Random Forest Recall jumped from 42.23% → 56.48%
- **Logistic Regression** saw the biggest Recall boost: 27.46% → 67.10% after SMOTE
- **Tuned Random Forest** achieved best cross-validation F1 of **86.61%** via GridSearchCV
- Without SMOTE all models were heavily biased toward predicting "Retained"
- **Top churn predictors:** Age, Estimated Salary, Active Member status, Country (Germany)
